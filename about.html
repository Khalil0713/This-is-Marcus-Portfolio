          <h2>Hi, I'm Marcus</h2>
          <p class="intro">
            I'm an IT student passionate about web development and solving complex problems. 
            My journey in tech started when I was a kid, playing through tons of video games 
            and wondering how they were made. When I was a High School student, I started to learn programming 
            and it was love at first sight. I did multiple basic school projects and sold them to my classmates.
            Throughout the years, I've been working on various projects and learning new technologies.  I was the leader of our Capstone Project which revolved around creating 
            a web application that helps students voice out their concerns. Namely, Boses Ng Iskolar. It helped Admins to monitor and manage the concerns of students
             and the Reports helped them analyze the data. My role was both full-stack development and project management.
